The cursor continues to throb, ‎relentlessly patient, until --‎                 MAN (V.O.) ‎Yeah?‎Data now slashes across the screen, information ‎flashing faster then we can read:  "Call trans opt:  ‎received. 2-19-98 13:24:18  REC:Log>."‎                 WOMAN (V.O.) ‎Is everything in place?‎On screen:  "Trace program:  running."‎We listen to the phone conversation as though we were ‎on a third line.

The first three numbers ‎suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.‎CYPHER (V.O.)‎You like him, don't you?  You like ‎watching him?‎We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each ‎digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place ‎like the wheels of a slot machine.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎1‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎1‎                 TRINITY (V.O.) ‎Don't be ridiculous.‎CYPHER (V.O.)‎We're going to kill him.

Suddenly, a ‎flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in ‎‎--‎‎2‎	INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT	‎2‎The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way ‎across the polyester carpeting, destroying several ‎rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, ‎leaving patterns of permanent shadow.‎We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights ‎as they creep down the blackened hall and ready ‎themselves on either side of Room 303.‎The biggest of them violently kicks in the door.  The other ‎cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.‎                 BIG COP ‎Police!  Freeze!‎The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a ‎foldup table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a ‎powerbook computer.  The only light in the room is the ‎glow of the computer.‎Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is ‎TRINITY; a woman in black leather.‎BIG COPHands behind your head!  Now!  Do ‎it!‎She slowly puts her hands behind her head.‎‎3‎	EXT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT	‎3‎A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through ‎the police cruisers.  AGENT SMITH, AGENT BROWN, and ‎AGENT JONES get out of the car.‎They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They ‎are also always hardwired; small Secret Service ‎earphones in one ear, the cord coiling back into their ‎shirt collars.‎                 AGENT SMITH ‎Lieutenant?‎                 LIEUTENANT ‎Oh shit.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎3‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎3‎AGENT SMITHLieutenant, you were given ‎specific orders --‎LIEUTENANTI'm just doing my job.  You gimme ‎that Juris-my dick-tion and you ‎can cram it up your ass.‎AGENT SMITHThe orders were for your ‎protection.‎The Lieutenant laughs.‎LIEUTENANTI think we can handle one little ‎girl.‎Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward ‎the hotel.‎LIEUTENANTI sent two units.  They're ‎bringing her down now.‎AGENT SMITHNo, Lieutenant, your men are ‎already dead.‎‎4‎	INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL	‎4‎The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops ‎holding a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, ‎they know they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches ‎with the cuffs and Trinity moves --‎It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly ‎fast.‎The eye blinks and Trinity's palm snaps up and the nose ‎explodes, blood erupting.  Her leg kicks with the force ‎of a wrecking ball and he flies back, a two-hundred-‎fifty pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into ‎the cop farthest from her.‎Trinity moves again, BULLETS RAKING the walls, ‎flashlights sweeping with panic as the remaining cops ‎try to stop a leather-clad ghost.‎A GUN still in the cop's hand is snatched, twisted, ‎andFIRED.  There is a final violent exchange of GUNFIRE ‎and when it's over, Trinity is the only one standing.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎4‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎4‎A flashlight rocks slowly to a stop.‎                 TRINITY ‎Shit.‎‎5‎	EXT.

The other end is ‎answered.‎                 MAN (V.O.) ‎Operator.‎TRINITYMorpheus!  The line was traced!  I ‎don't know how.‎‎                        MORPHEUS ‎‎(MANV.O.) I know.  They cut the ‎hardline.‎This line is not a viable ‎exit.‎                 TRINITY ‎Are there any Agents?‎                 MORPHEUS (V.O.) ‎Yes.‎                 TRINITY ‎Goddamnit!‎MORPHEUS (V.O.)‎You have to focus.  There is a ‎phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can ‎make it.‎She takes a deep breath, centering herself.‎TRINITYAll right --‎                 MORPHEUS (V.O.) ‎Go.‎She drops the phone.‎‎7‎INT. HALLShe bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the ‎hall, leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to ‎the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto ‎the fire escape.‎‎7‎‎8‎EXT. FIRE ESCAPEIn the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at ‎her.  She can only go up.‎‎8‎‎9‎EXT. ROOF‎9‎On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over ‎the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.‎Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, ‎her movements so clean, gliding in and out of each ‎jump, contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops. ‎Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.‎The roof falls away into a wide back alley.  The next ‎building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is ‎perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other ‎roof.‎                 COP That's ‎it, we got her now.‎The cops slow, realizing they are about to see ‎something ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, ‎launching herself into the air.‎From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as ‎she hangs in flight, then hits, somersaulting up, ‎still running hard.‎                 COP Jesus Christ -- ‎that's impossible!‎They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the move ‎exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder up onto one knee.‎It is a dizzying chase up and over the dark plateaued ‎landscape of rooftops and sheer cliffs of brick.  ‎Ahead, she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the ‎point where her path drops away into a paved chasm, ‎there is!--‎‎10‎	EXT. WINDOW	‎10‎A yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick building.‎Trinity zeros in on it, running as hard as she can and --‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎10‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎10‎Hurtles herself into the empty night space, her body ‎leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her ‎head as the whole world seems to spin on its axis --‎A10‎	INT. BACK STAIRWELL	A10‎And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, ‎then falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing ‎down stairs bleeding, broken -But still alive.‎She wheels on the smashed opening above, her gun ‎instantly in her hand, trained, waiting for Agent ‎Brown but is met by only a slight WIND that HISSES ‎against the fanged maw of broken glass. Trinity tries ‎to move.  Everything hurts.‎                 TRINITY Get up, ‎Trinity.  You're fine.‎Get up -- just get up!‎She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.‎‎11‎	EXT. STREET	‎11‎Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at ‎the end of the block, in a pool of white street light, ‎she sees it!-The telephone booth.‎Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk, ‎focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the ‎PHONE begins to RING.‎Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, ‎it'sTIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.  Trinity sees the ‎headlights of the truck arcing at the telephone booth ‎as if taking aim.‎Gritting through the pain, she races the truck, ‎slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly ‎bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as -‎She answers the phone.‎There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking ‎mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --‎‎(CONTINUED)‎THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎‎11‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎11‎Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick ‎wall, SMASHING it to PLEXIGLAS PULP.‎After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab ‎of the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the ‎wreckage. There is no body.  Trinity is gone.‎His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.‎Agent Jones and Brown walk up behind him.‎                 AGENT JONES ‎She got out.‎                 AGENT SMITH ‎It doesn't matter.‎                 AGENT BROWN ‎The informant is real.‎Agent Smith almost smiles.‎                 AGENT SMITH ‎Yes.‎                 AGENT JONES We have the ‎name of their next target.‎                 AGENT BROWN ‎The name is Neo.‎The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated ‎in the crash like a severed limb.‎                 AGENT SMITH ‎We'll need a search running.‎                 AGENT JONES ‎It's already begun.‎We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, ‎CLOSER and CLOSER, until the smooth gray plastic ‎spreads out like a horizon and the small holes widen ‎until we FALL THROUGH one -Swallowed by DARKNESS.‎The DARKNESS CRACKLES with phosphorescent energy, the ‎word "searching" blazing in around us as we EMERGE FROM ‎a computer screen.‎The screen flickers with windowing data as a search ‎engine runs with a steady relentless rhythm.‎We DRIFT BACK FROM the screen and INTO --‎‎12‎	INT. NEO'S APARTMENT	‎12‎It is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with ‎technology.‎Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into ‎thickets that wind up and around the legs of several ‎desks.  Tabletops are filled with cannibalized ‎equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse.‎At the center of this technological rat-nest is NEO, a ‎man who knows more about living inside a computer than ‎outside one.‎He is asleep in front of his PC.  Behind him, the ‎computer screen suddenly goes blank.  A prompt appears: ‎‎"Wake up, Neo."‎Neo's eye pries open.  He sits up, one eye still ‎closed, looking around, unsure of where he is.  He ‎notices the screen. He types "CTRL X" but the letter ‎‎"T" appears.‎                 NEO ‎What...?‎He hits another and an "H" appears.  He keeps typing, ‎pushing random functions and keys while the computer ‎types out a message as though it had a mind of its own.‎He stops and stares at the four words on the screen:‎‎"The Matrix has you."‎                 NEO ‎What the hell?‎He hits the "ESC" button.  Another message appears:‎‎"Follow the white rabbit."‎He hits it again and the message repeats.  He rubs his ‎eyes but when he opens them, there is another message: ‎‎"Knock, knock, Neo."‎Someone KNOCKS on his door and he almost jumps out of ‎his chair.  He looks back at the computer, but the ‎screen is now blank. Someone KNOCKS again.  Neo rises, ‎still unnerved.‎                 NEO ‎Who is it?‎                 CHOI (O.S) ‎It's Choi.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎12‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎12‎Neo flips a series of locks and opens the door, ‎leaving the chain on.  A young Chinese MAN stands ‎there with several of his friends.‎                 NEO ‎You're two hours late.‎                 CHOI (MAN) ‎I know.  It's her fault.‎                 NEO ‎You got the money?‎                 CHOI ‎Two grand.‎He takes out an envelope and gives it to Neo through ‎the cracked door.‎                 NEO ‎Hold on.‎He closes the door.  On the floor near his bed is a book,‎Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulations.  The book has ‎been hollowed out and inside are several computer ‎disks. He takes one, sticks the money in the book and ‎drops it on the floor. Opening the door, he hands the ‎disk to Choi.‎CHOIHallelujah!  You are my Savior, ‎man!  My own personal Jesus ‎Christ!‎                 NEO If you get ‎caught using that --‎CHOII know, I know.  This never ‎happened.  You don't exist.‎                 NEO ‎Right...‎Neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly ‎returns.‎CHOISomething wrong, man?  You look a ‎little whiter than usual.‎                 NEO I don't ‎know... My computer...‎‎12‎CONTINUED:  (2)‎He looks back at Choi, unable to explain what just ‎happened.‎NEOYou ever have the feeling that ‎you're not sure if you're awake or ‎still dreaming?‎CHOIAll the time.  It's called ‎mescaline and it is the only way ‎to fly.‎He smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog.‎CHOIIt sounds to me like you need to ‎unplug, man.  A little R&R.  What ‎do you think, Dujour, should we ‎take him with us?‎                 DUJOUR ‎Definitely.‎                 NEO I can't.  I ‎have to work tomorrow.‎DUJOURCome on.  It'll be fun.  I ‎promise.‎He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her ‎black leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  ‎bands, symbols, slogans, military medals and -A ‎small white rabbit.

APARTMENT‎13‎An older apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of ‎small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements.‎Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there ‎are.‎Dressed predominately in black, people are everywhere, ‎gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like ‎jungle cats around a tree.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎CONTINUED:‎Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle ‎of beer, feeling completely out of place.  He is about ‎to leave when he notices a woman staring at him. The ‎woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.‎In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against ‎each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.‎                 TRINITY ‎Hello, Neo.‎                 NEO How do ‎you know that name?‎TRINITYI know a lot about you.

I know why ‎you're here, Neo.  I know what ‎you've been doing.  I know why ‎you hardly sleep, why you live ‎alone and why, night after night, ‎you sit at your computer.  You're ‎looking for him.‎Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ‎ear.‎TRINITYI know because I was once looking ‎for the same thing, but when he ‎found me he told me I wasn't ‎really looking for him.  I was ‎looking for an answer.‎There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels ‎the words, like a drug, seeping into him.‎TRINITYIt's the question that drives us, ‎the question that brought you ‎here.  You know the question just ‎as I did.‎                 NEO ‎What is the Matrix?‎THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/22/98‎CONTINUED:  (3)‎TRINITYWhen I asked him, he said that no ‎one could ever be told the answer ‎to that question.

You believe that ‎you are special, that somehow the ‎rules do not apply to you. ‎Obviously, you are mistaken.‎‎16‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎16‎His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.‎RHINEHEARTThis company is one of the top ‎software companies in the world ‎because every single employee ‎understands that they are a part ‎of a whole.

The name on the ‎file:‎‎"Anderson, Thomas!A."‎CONTINUED:‎AGENT SMITHAs you can see, we've had our eye ‎on you for some time now, Mr. ‎Anderson.‎He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he ‎flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at ‎the file or at him.‎AGENT SMITHIt seems that you have been ‎living two lives.  In one life, ‎you are Thomas A. Anderson, ‎program writer for a respectable ‎software company.  You have a ‎social security number, you pay ‎your taxes and you help your ‎landlady carry out her garbage.‎The pages continue to turn.‎AGENT SMITHThe other life is lived in ‎computers where you go by the ‎hacker alias Neo, and are guilty ‎of virtually every computer crime ‎we have a law for.‎Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.‎                 AGENT SMITH One ‎of these lives has a future.‎One of them does not.‎He closes the file.‎AGENT SMITHI'm going to be as forthcoming asI can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are ‎here because we need your help.‎He removes his sunglasses, his eyes are an unnatural ‎iceblue.‎AGENT SMITHWe know that you have been ‎contacted by a certain individual. ‎A man who calls himself Morpheus. ‎Whatever you think you know about ‎this man is irrelevant.  The fact ‎is that he is wanted for acts of ‎terrorism in more countries than ‎any other man in the world.‎‎(MORE)‎‎(CONTINUED)‎CONTINUED:  (2)‎AGENT SMITH (CONT'D)‎He is considered by many ‎authorities to be the most ‎dangerous man alive.‎He leans closer.‎AGENT SMITHMy colleagues believe that I am ‎wasting my time with you but I ‎believe you want to do the right ‎thing.  It is obvious that you ‎are an intelligent man, Mr. ‎Anderson, and that you are ‎interested in the future.  That ‎is why I believe you are ready to ‎put your past mistakes behind you ‎and get on with your life.‎Neo tries to match his stare.‎AGENT SMITHWe are willing to wipe the slate ‎clean, to give you a fresh start ‎and all we are asking in return is ‎your cooperation in bringing a ‎known terrorist to justice.‎Neo nods to himself.‎NEOYeah.  Wow.  That sounds like a ‎real good deal.  But I think I ‎have a better one.

From ‎a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a ‎long, fiber-optic wire tap.‎Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over ‎his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the ‎electronic device animates, becoming an organic ‎creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a ‎fluke worm.‎Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe intoNeo's navel.

Pressing up, ‎the surface distends, stretching like a red rubber ‎cocoon.‎Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing ‎at the thinning elastic shroud, until it ruptures, a ‎hole widening around his mouth as he sucks for air.  ‎Tearing himself free, he emerges from the cell. It is ‎Neo.‎He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.‎Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.‎He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled ‎with magenta gelatin, the surface of which has solidified ‎like curdled milk.  The IVs in his arms are plugged into ‎outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh.‎He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to ‎the back of his head where he finds an enormous ‎coaxial plugged and locked into the base of his skull.  ‎He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull ‎off a finger.‎To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with ‎magenta gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and ‎motionless, he sees other human beings.‎Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All ‎connected to a center core, each capsule like a red, ‎dimly-glowing petal attached to a black metal stem.‎Above him, level after level, the stem rises seemingly ‎forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and ‎looks out.  The image assaults his mind.‎Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible ‎heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an ‎underwater abyss.‎His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the ‎intensity of the vision.

A long, clear plastic ‎needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior ofNeo's skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  ‎The other connective hoses snap free and snake away as ‎the machine lets Neo go.‎Suddenly, the back of the unit opens and a tremendous ‎vacuum, like an airplane door opening, sucks the ‎gelatin and then Neo into a black hole.‎‎31‎INT.

There is a futuristic IV plugged into ‎the jack in his forearm.  He pulls it out, staring at the ‎grafted outlet.‎He runs his hand over the short hair now covering his ‎head.  His fingers find and explore the large outlet ‎in the base of his skull.‎Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the ‎door.‎                 NEO Morpheus, ‎what's happened to me?‎What is this place?‎                 MORPHEUS More ‎important than what is when?‎                 NEO ‎When?‎MORPHEUSYou believe the year is 1997 when ‎in fact it is much closer to 2197. ‎I can't say for certain what year ‎it is because we honestly do not ‎know.‎The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.‎MORPHEUSThere is no reason for me to try ‎to explain it when I can simply ‎show it.

Those ‎two guys are Tank and Dozer.‎The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.‎MORPHEUSAnd this, this is the Core.  This ‎is where we broadcast our pirate ‎signal and hack into the Matrix.‎It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines ‎of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic ‎battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and ‎banks of life systems and computer monitors.‎At the center of the web, there are six ecto-skeleton ‎chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness. ‎Near the circle of chairs is the control console and ‎operator's station where the network is monitored.‎MORPHEUSYou want to know what the Matrix ‎is, Neo?  The answer is right ‎here.‎He touches the back of Neo's head.‎                 MORPHEUS ‎Help him, Trinity.‎Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the ‎chairs.‎He feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at ‎the back of his neck.

How do you define ‎real?  If you're talking about ‎what you feel, taste, smell, or ‎see, then real is simply ‎electrical signals interpreted by ‎your brain.‎He picks up a remote control and clicks on the ‎television.  On the television, we see images of the ‎Twentieth Century city where Neo lived.‎MORPHEUSThis is the world you know.  The ‎world as it was at the end of the ‎Twentieth Century.  It exists now ‎only as part of a ‎neuralinteractive simulation that ‎we call the Matrix.‎He changes the channel and we see a very different city ‎as we enter the television.‎MORPHEUSYou have been living inside a ‎dreamworld, Neo.  As inBaudrillard's vision, your whole ‎life has been spent inside the ‎map, not the territory.  This is ‎the world as it exists today.‎In the distance, we see the ruins of a future city ‎protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs ‎of a long-dead corpse.‎MORPHEUS            ‎'The desert of the real.' ‎Beneath us, the water is gone.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎39‎	CONTINUED:  (2)‎	‎39‎We TURN AND DESCEND, SPIRALING DOWN TOWARD the lake bed ‎which is scorched and split like burnt flesh, where we ‎FIND Morpheus and Neo.  Neo clings to the chair, trying ‎to get his bearings.‎MORPHEUSWe have only bits and pieces of ‎information.  What we know for ‎certain is that, at some point in ‎the early Twenty-first Century, ‎all of mankind was united in ‎celebration.  Through the ‎blinding inebriation of hubris, ‎we marveled at our magnificence ‎as we gave birth to A.I.‎NEOA.I.?  You mean artificial ‎intelligence?‎MORPHEUSYes.  A singular consciousness ‎that spawned an entire race of ‎machines.  I must say I find it ‎almost funny to imagine the world ‎slapping itself on the back, ‎toasting the new age.  I say ‎almost funny.‎He looks up and his sunglasses reflect the obsidian ‎clouds roiling overhead.‎                 MORPHEUS We ‎don't know who struck first.‎Us or them.  But we do know it was ‎us that scorched the sky.  At the ‎time, they were dependent on solar ‎power.  It was believed they would ‎be unable to survive without an ‎energy source as abundant as the ‎sun.‎As we DESCEND INTO the circular window of his glasses, ‎there is a flash of lightning.‎MORPHEUSThroughout human history, we have ‎been dependent on machines to ‎survive.  Fate, it seems, is not ‎without a sense of irony.‎‎40‎	EXT. FETUS FIELDS	‎40‎On the flash, we PULL BACK from the darkness which ‎reveals itself to be the black eye of a fetus.‎MORPHEUSThe Machines discovered a new ‎form of fusion.  All they needed ‎was a small electrical charge to ‎initiate the reaction.‎The fetus is suspended in a placenta-like husk, where its ‎malleable skull is already growing around the brain-jack.‎MORPHEUSThe human body generates more ‎bioelectricity than a 120-volt ‎battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s ‎of body heat.‎The husk hanging from a stalk is plucked by a ‎thresherlike farm machine.‎MORPHEUSThere are fields, endless fields ‎where human beings are no longer ‎born; we are grown.‎We RISE UP, the field stretching in every direction to ‎the horizon, lightning tearing open the sky as a ‎harvester sweeps past us.‎A40‎	INT. POWER PLANT	A40‎From the yawning black of the waste port, we begin to ‎PULL BACK as it snaps shut.‎Red amniotic gel flows into the pod below us, pooling ‎around a tiny newborn that suckles its feed tube.‎MORPHEUSFor the longest time, I wouldn't ‎believe it.  But then I saw the ‎fields with my own eyes, watched ‎them liquefy the dead so they ‎could be fed intravenously to the ‎living and standing there, facing ‎the efficiency, the pure, ‎horrifying precision, I came to ‎realize the obviousness of the ‎truth.‎Still PULLING BACK, we see the image of the power plant ‎now on the television as we return to the white space ‎of the construct.‎‎41‎	INT.

It is dangerous. ‎They have trouble letting go.‎Their mind turns against ‎them.‎I've seen it happen.  I'm ‎sorry.‎I broke the rule because I had ‎to.‎He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to ‎himself as to Neo.‎MORPHEUSWhen the Matrix was first built ‎there was a man born inside that ‎had the ability to change what he ‎wanted, to remake the Matrix as ‎he saw fit.  It was this man that ‎freed the first of us and taught ‎us the truth; as long as the ‎Matrix exists, the human race ‎will never be free.‎He pauses.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎43‎	‎43‎MORPHEUSWhen he died, the Oracle ‎prophesied his return and ‎envisioned that his coming would ‎hail the destruction of the ‎Matrix, an end to the war and ‎freedom for our people.  That is ‎why there are those of us that ‎have spent our entire lives ‎searching the Matrix, looking for ‎him.‎Neo can feel his eyes on him.‎MORPHEUSI did what I did because I believe ‎the search is over.‎He stands up.‎MORPHEUSGet some rest.

A PHONE begins to RING.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎‎219‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎219‎It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the ‎trace program.  After a long beat, we recognize Neo's ‎voice.‎NEO (V.O.)‎Hi.  It's me.  I know you're out ‎there.  I can feel you now.‎We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering ‎across the screen.‎                 NEO (V.O.) I ‎imagine you can also feel me.‎The numbers begin to lock into place.‎NEO (V.O.)‎You won't have to search for me ‎anymore.  I'm done running.  Done ‎hiding.  Whether I'm done ‎fighting, I suppose, is up to ‎you.‎We GLIDE IN TOWARDS the screen.‎NEO (V.O.)‎I believe deep down, we both want ‎this world to change.  I believe ‎that the Matrix can remain our ‎cage or it can become our ‎chrysalis, that's what you helped ‎me to understand.  That to be ‎free, you cannot change your ‎cage. You have to change ‎yourself.‎We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the ‎darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of ‎stars.‎NEO (V.O.)‎When I used to look out at this ‎world, all I could see was its ‎edges, its boundaries, its rules ‎and controls, its leaders and ‎laws.  But now, I see another ‎world.  A different world where ‎all things are possible.  A world ‎of hope.  Of peace.‎We realize that the constellation is actually the holes ‎in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.‎NEO (V.O.)‎I can't tell you how to get there, ‎but I know if you can free your ‎mind, you'll find the way.‎THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎‎125A.‎‎220‎EXT.

He looks up and we RISE. HIGHER ‎and HIGHER, until the city is miles below.‎After a moment, Neo blasts by us, his long, black coat ‎billowing like a black leather cape as he flies faster ‎than a speeding bullet.‎                         FADE OUT. ‎THE END‎1.‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎1.‎‎1.‎‎1.‎‎1.‎‎13‎	‎13‎‎1.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎1.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎1.‎‎13‎	‎13‎‎1.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎(CONTINUED)‎‎1.‎‎13‎	‎13‎‎(CONTINUED)‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎17‎	‎17‎‎1.‎‎17‎	‎17‎‎(CONTINUED)‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎17‎	‎17‎‎(CONTINUED)‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎20‎	‎20‎‎1.‎‎20‎	‎20‎‎1.‎‎(CONTINUED)‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎CONTINUED:‎‎1.‎‎20‎	‎20‎‎1.‎‎28‎	CONTINUED:‎	‎28‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎CONTINUED:‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎CONTINUED:‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎28‎	‎28‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎1.‎‎28‎	‎28‎‎1.‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎	THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98‎	‎1.‎‎1.
