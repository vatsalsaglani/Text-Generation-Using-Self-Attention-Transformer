COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - DAY ‎	‎1 ‎‎ ‎‎      It's gray.  The platform is packed with business commuters:       ‎suits, overcoats.  There is such a lack of color it almost       ‎seems as if it's a black and white shot, except one commuter       ‎holds a bright red heart-shaped box of candy under his arm.       ‎The platform across the tracks is empty.  As an almost empty       ‎train pulls up to that platform, one of the suited men breaks       ‎out of the crowd, lurches up the stairs two at a time,       hurries ‎across the overpass and down the stairs to the other       side, ‎just at the empty train stops.  The doors open and the       man ‎gets on that train.  As the empty train pulls from the       ‎station, the man watches the crowd of commuters through the       ‎train's dirty window.  We see his face for the first time.       ‎This is Joel Barish.  He is in his 30's, sallow, a bit puffy.       ‎His hair is a little messy, his suit is either vintage or       just ‎old and dirty and sort of threadbare.  His bright tie       has a ‎photograph of a rodeo printed on it. ‎‎ ‎‎2‎	EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION - DAY ‎	‎2 ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel talks on a payphone.  The wind howls around him.  He       ‎tries to shield the mouthpiece as he talks.  His speech is a       ‎self-conscious mumble, especially difficult to hear over the       ‎elements. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 Hi, Cindy.  It's Joel.  Joel.  I'm not                  ‎feeling well this morning.  No, food                  ‎poisoning, I think.  I had clams.  Clams!                  ‎I'm sorry it took me so long to call in,                  ‎but I've been vomiting a lot.  I've been                  ‎vomiting!  Yes, that's right, a lot! ‎‎ ‎‎3‎	EXT. BEACH - DAY ‎	‎3 ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel wanders the windy, empty beach, with his briefcase.  He       ‎passes an old man with a metal detector.  They nod at each       ‎other. ‎‎ ‎‎4‎	EXT. BEACH - DAY ‎	‎4 ‎‎ ‎‎      Later: Joel looks out at the ocean. ‎‎ ‎‎5‎	EXT. BEACH - DAY ‎	‎5 ‎‎ ‎‎      Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls a big, tattered notebook       ‎from his briefcase.  He opens it and reads his last entry. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL (V.O.) ‎‎                 January 6, 2001.  Nothing much.  Naomi                  ‎and I coexisting.  Roommates.  Nothing.                  ‎Will it go on like this forever?  My best                  ‎guess?  Yes. ‎‎ ‎‎5     CONTINUED: ‎	‎5 ‎‎ ‎‎      Under the entry is a detailed drawing of a paranoid, wild-        ‎eyed man huddled in the corner of a damp basement lit by a       ‎bare bulb on a cord.  Joel notices something odd: a great       many ‎pages have been torn out after the last entry.  He        ponders it ‎for a moment, then writes on the next page: ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) ‎‎                 Valentine's Day 2003.  First entry in two                  ‎years.  Where did those years go?  If                  ‎you're not careful it gets away from you.                  ‎And then it's over and you're dead.  And                  ‎within a few years who even remembers you                  ‎were here?                      (thinks) ‎‎                 Called in sick today.  Took the train out                  ‎to Montauk. ‎‎                     (thinks) ‎‎                 Cold. ‎‎                     (thinks some more) ‎‎                 Don't know what else to say.  I saw Naomi                  ‎last night.  First time since the break-                  ‎up.  We had sex.  It was odd to fall into                  ‎our old familiar sex life so easily.                  Like ‎no time has passed.  Suddenly we're                  ‎talking about getting together again.  I                  ‎guess that's good. ‎‎ ‎‎      He has no other thoughts, does some work on the drawing on       ‎the opposite page.  He glances up, spots a female figure in       ‎the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands out        ‎against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt.       ‎This is Clementine.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig.  He       ‎watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his       ‎drawing, or at least pretends to.  Once she has passed, he       ‎watches her walk away.  She stops and stares out at the        ‎ocean.  Joel writes. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) ‎‎                 Constitutionally incapable of making eye-                  ‎contact with a woman I don't know.  Guess                  I'd ‎better get back with Naomi.  Ought to                  buy her ‎a Valentine.  She loves roses, I                  believe. ‎‎ ‎‎6‎	EXT. BEACH - DAY ‎	‎6 ‎‎ ‎‎      LATER: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the       ‎season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window. ‎‎ ‎‎7‎	EXT. BEACH - DAY ‎	‎7 ‎‎ ‎‎      LATER: Joel digs into the sand with a stick. ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎8‎	INT. DINER - DAY ‎	‎8 ‎‎ ‎‎      It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  An old       ‎couple drink coffee at the counter.  Joel sits in a booth and       ‎eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup.  In       ‎his notebook he is drawing a wizened old man with a metal       ‎detector.  His metal detector has led him to another dead old       ‎man clutching a metal detector.  Joel meekly, unsuccessfully,       ‎tries to get the waitress's attention for more coffee.       ‎Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel       ‎glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth       ‎and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress        ‎approaches her with a coffee pot. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Hi, it's me again!  My home away from                  ‎home. ‎‎ ‎‎                           WAITRESS                  ‎Coffee? ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 God, yes.  You've saved my life!  Brrr! ‎‎ ‎‎      The waitress pours the coffee. ‎‎ ‎‎                           WAITRESS ‎‎                 You know what you want? ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                     (laughing) ‎‎                 Ain't that the question of the century. ‎‎ ‎‎      The waitress is not amused.  Clementine gets business-like. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  ‎You got grilled cheese and tomato soup                  ‎again today? ‎‎ ‎‎                           WAITRESS ‎‎                 We're having a run on it. ‎‎ ‎‎      The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her       ‎bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment,       ‎pours something in, then brings the cup back up. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                     (calling) ‎‎                 And some cream, please. ‎‎ ‎‎      Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's       ‎before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He       ‎looks embarrassed, then down at his journal. ‎‎8‎	CONTINUED: ‎	‎8 ‎‎ ‎‎      Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.       ‎Joel glances up, tries to see the book's cover.  It's blue       ‎and white.  He can't make out the title. ‎‎ ‎‎9‎	EXT. BEACH - DAY ‎	‎9 ‎‎  ‎‎      Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine       ‎stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at       ‎the ocean. ‎‎ ‎‎10‎	EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON ‎	‎10  ‎‎      Joel sits on a bench waiting for the train.  Clementine       ‎enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there.       ‎She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if       ‎they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes       ‎a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his        ‎hands, pulls his journal from his briefcase and tries to        ‎write in order to conceal his awkwardness. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL (V.O.) ‎‎                 Why do I fall in love with every woman I                  ‎see who shows me the least bit of                  attention? ‎‎ ‎‎11‎	INT. TRAIN - LATE AFTERNOON ‎	‎11 ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the       ‎slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door       ‎between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up.       ‎Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding       ‎where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of       ‎the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching        ‎him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally: ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                     (calling over the rumble)                  ‎Hi! ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel looks over. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 I'm sorry? ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 What?  I couldn't hear you. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 I said, I'm sorry. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Why are you sorry?  I just said hi. ‎‎11    CONTINUED: ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 No, I didn't know if you were talking to                  ‎me, so... ‎‎ ‎‎      She looks around the empty car. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE                  ‎Really? ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                     (embarrassed) ‎‎                 Well, I didn't want to assume. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the                  ‎leap and assume someone is talking to you                  ‎in an otherwise empty car. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi.  Hello.  Hi. ‎‎ ‎‎      Clementine giggles, makes her way down the aisle toward Joel. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't                  ‎have to scream?  Not that I don't need to                  ‎scream sometimes, believe you me. ‎‎                     (pause) ‎‎                 But I don't want to bug you if you're                  ‎trying to write something. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL                      ‎‎(mumbling) ‎‎                 No, I'm just...

You don't really what? ‎‎ ‎‎      She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she       ‎came from. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 It's okay if you want to sit down. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe.                  ‎I have a long trip ahead of me. ‎‎                     (sits across aisle from Joel)                  ‎How far are you going?  On the train, I                  ‎mean, of course.  Not in life. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 Rockville Center. ‎‎11    CONTINUED: (2) ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Get out!  Me too!  What are the odds? ‎‎ ‎‎      She stares at him.  He gets uncomfortable. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) ‎‎                 Do I know you? ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 I don't think so. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Hmmmm.

I                  ‎hide in the back as much as is humanly                  ‎possible.  You have a cell phone?  I need                  to ‎quit right this minute.

And the                  landlord's sweet, ‎which is bizarre, but                  great, and I have a ‎little porch in the                  back, which is great, ‎because I can read                  there, and listen to my ‎crickets and... ‎‎ ‎‎      Clementine is in the living room now with two gin and tonics. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) ‎‎                 Two blue ruins... ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel is looking at a framed black and white photograph of       ‎crows flying. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) ‎‎                 You like that? ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 Very much. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 This... this guy gave that to me, just,                  ‎like, recently.  I like it, too.  I like                  ‎crows.

That's a good caw you did.  Your                  ‎caw is something to crow about. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE                  ‎Huh? ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel shakes his head embarrassedly and mumbles something. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  ‎Do you believe in that stuff?                  ‎Reincarnation? ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 I don't know. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Me neither.

I'm not, like, a Robert Frost                  ‎lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems                  ‎strictly grade school to me.  But this                  ‎made me cry for some reason.  Maybe                  ‎because it is grade school.  Y'know? ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 It's pretty. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 I miss grade school.  I don't know why                  ‎I'm calling it grade school all of a                  ‎sudden.  When I went we called it                   ‎elementary school.  But I like grade                  ‎school better.  Sounds like something                  ‎someone from the forties would call it.                  ‎I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore                  ‎hats.  Anyway, cheers! ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL                  ‎Cheers. ‎‎ ‎‎      They clink glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp       ‎of her drink.  Joel sips.

Well, have a seat, anyway. ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel sits in a chair across the room.

Put some music on. ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 What do you want to hear? ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (O.S.) ‎‎                 You pick it. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 You just say.

Just pick something good. ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can       ‎performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at.       ‎Clementine reenters with her drink. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) ‎‎                 Oh, excellent choice. ‎‎ ‎‎      She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is       ‎dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the       ‎couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)                  ‎Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.

There's a silence,       ‎which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL ‎‎                 Well, I should probably get going. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 No, stay.

There are       ‎several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade       costumes: ‎a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher       potato, a ‎housewife potato.  He stares at the potatoes,       confused.  ‎Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill        for herself. ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL                  ‎Thanks. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Drink up, young man.  It'll make the                  ‎whole seduction part less repugnant. ‎‎ ‎‎      Joel looks a little alarmed. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) ‎‎                 I'm just kidding.

She opens her       ‎eyes, smiles drunkenly at him, winks. ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) ‎‎                 Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. ‎‎ ‎‎ ‎‎16    CONTINUED: (4) ‎‎ ‎‎                           JOEL                  ‎Yeah? ‎‎ ‎‎                           CLEMENTINE ‎‎                 Well, I go to a psychic and she's always                  ‎telling me I'm psychic.

Kind of a goofball,                  ‎but he's really stuck on me, which is                  ‎flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And                  ‎he's, like, a dope, but he says these                  smart ‎and moving things sometimes, out of                  ‎nowhere, that just break my heart.

Y'know?  ‎And that's where my psychic                  stuff comes ‎in.

This leads to groping, partial       ‎undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the       unconscious ‎Joel.  The woman checks the address on Joel's       building.  Stan ‎recognizes her.  As the woman approaches the       only lit window, ‎Stan agonizes over what to do.  He honks his       horn.  The woman ‎looks back at the van, then hurries to the       window.

I saw other people                  ‎having fun and I wanted it.

He opens his eyes and casually watches a distant       ‎figure walking in the direction of Clementine's house on the       ‎otherwise empty sidewalk.  As the figure nears, Joel sees       it's ‎a young man. ‎‎162   CONTINUED: ‎	‎162 ‎‎ ‎‎      The young man gets closer and we see that it's Patrick.
